      "[0.00s - 5.76s]:  Well, today's topic is a topic we all think about while doing our best not to think about it.\n",
      "[5.76s - 7.84s]:  The topic is death.\n",
      "[7.84s - 13.80s]:  And how we think about death changes depending on whether we're thinking about dying ourselves\n",
      "[13.80s - 16.44s]:  or about losing the people we love.\n",
      "[16.44s - 23.00s]:  But whichever side of the coin we take here, death is really an ever-present reality for\n",
      "[23.00s - 24.00s]:  us.\n",
      "[24.00s - 27.24s]:  And it is so whether we're thinking about it or not.\n",
      "[27.24s - 33.64s]:  It's always announcing itself in the background, on the news, in our concerns about our own\n",
      "[33.64s - 34.92s]:  health.\n",
      "[34.92s - 39.96s]:  If you observe yourself closely, you'll see that you spend a fair amount of energy each\n",
      "[39.96s - 43.24s]:  day trying not to die.\n",
      "[43.24s - 47.54s]:  Death makes a mockery of almost everything else we spend our lives doing.\n",
      "[47.54s - 52.32s]:  Just take a moment to reflect on how you've spent your day so far, the kinds of things\n",
      "[52.32s - 57.20s]:  that captured your attention, the things that you've been genuinely worried about.\n",
      "[57.36s - 61.60s]:  Over the last few days, I've been spending an inordinate amount of time trying to find\n",
      "[61.60s - 64.72s]:  a new font for my podcast.\n",
      "[64.72s - 68.32s]:  This has literally absorbed hours of my time.\n",
      "[68.32s - 73.52s]:  So if you had stopped me at any point in the last 48 hours and asked me what I'm up to,\n",
      "[73.52s - 79.44s]:  what deep problem I'm attempting to solve, the honest answer would have been, I'm looking\n",
      "[79.44s - 81.20s]:  for a font.\n",
      "[81.20s - 85.60s]:  Now I'm not saying that everything we do has to be profound in every moment.\n",
      "[85.68s - 88.28s]:  I mean, sometimes you just have to find a font.\n",
      "[88.28s - 95.00s]:  But contemplating the brevity of life brings some perspective to how we use our attention.\n",
      "[95.00s - 99.08s]:  It's not so much what we pay attention to, it's the quality of attention.\n",
      "[99.08s - 101.88s]:  It's how we feel while doing it.\n",
      "[101.88s - 106.72s]:  If you need to spend the next hour looking for a font, you might as well enjoy it.\n",
      "[106.72s - 111.04s]:  Because the truth is none of us know how much time we have in this life.\n",
      "[111.04s - 116.68s]:  And taking that fact to heart brings a kind of moral and emotional clarity to the present.\n",
      "[116.68s - 120.96s]:  And it can bring a resolve to not suffer over stupid things.\n",
      "[120.96s - 125.52s]:  When you take something like Road Rage, you're behind the wheel of your car and somebody\n",
      "[125.52s - 130.52s]:  does something erratic or they're probably just driving more slowly than you want.\n",
      "[130.52s - 132.88s]:  And you find yourself getting angry.\n",
      "[132.88s - 138.60s]:  Now I would submit to you that that kind of thing is impossible if you're being mindful\n",
      "[138.60s - 140.84s]:  of the shortness of life.\n",
      "[140.84s - 146.12s]:  If you're aware that you are going to die and that the other person is going to die,\n",
      "[146.12s - 151.80s]:  and that you're both going to lose everyone you love and you don't know when, you've\n",
      "[151.80s - 159.52s]:  got this moment of life, this beautiful moment, this moment where your consciousness is bright,\n",
      "[159.52s - 166.40s]:  where it's not dimmed by morphine in the hospital on your last day among the living.\n",
      "[166.40s - 171.16s]:  And the sun is out or it's raining, both are beautiful.\n",
      "[171.16s - 177.52s]:  And your spouse is alive and your children are alive and you're driving.\n",
      "[177.52s - 184.00s]:  And that person in front of you, who you will never meet, whose hopes and sorrows you know\n",
      "[184.00s - 186.04s]:  nothing about.\n",
      "[186.04s - 190.64s]:  But which if you could know them, you would recognize are impressively similar to your\n",
      "[190.64s - 194.44s]:  own, is just driving slow.\n",
      "[194.44s - 201.80s]:  This is your life, the only one you've got and you will never get this moment back again.\n",
      "[201.80s - 206.44s]:  And you don't know how many more moments you have.\n",
      "[206.44s - 210.80s]:  No matter how many times you do something, there will come a day when you do it for the\n",
      "[210.80s - 213.04s]:  last time.\n",
      "[213.04s - 218.88s]:  You've had a thousand chances to tell the people closest to you that you love them in a way\n",
      "[218.88s - 226.36s]:  that they feel it and in a way that you feel it and you've missed most of them.\n",
      "[226.36s - 229.28s]:  And you don't know how many more you're going to get.\n",
      "[229.28s - 234.56s]:  You've got this next interaction with another human being to make the world a marginally\n",
      "[234.56s - 235.72s]:  better place.\n",
      "[235.72s - 242.12s]:  You've got this one opportunity to fall in love with existence.\n",
      "[242.12s - 245.80s]:  So why not relax and enjoy your life?\n",
      "[245.80s - 247.68s]:  Really relax.\n",
      "[247.68s - 254.72s]:  Even in the midst of struggle, even under uncertainty, you are in a game right now and\n",
      "[254.72s - 257.64s]:  you can't see the clock.\n",
      "[257.64s - 260.00s]:  So you don't know how much time you have left.\n",
      "[260.00s - 264.48s]:  And yet you're free to make the game as interesting as possible.\n",
      "[264.48s - 266.80s]:  You can even change the rules.\n",
      "[266.80s - 270.20s]:  You can discover new games that no one has thought of yet.\n",
      "[270.20s - 274.16s]:  You can literally build a rocket to go to Mars.\n",
      "[274.60s - 280.56s]:  I actually know people who will spend some part of today doing that.\n",
      "[280.56s - 287.84s]:  But whatever you do, however seemingly ordinary, you can feel the preciousness of life.\n",
      "[287.84s - 292.00s]:  And an awareness of death is the doorway into that way of being in the world.\n"
