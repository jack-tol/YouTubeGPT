# YouTubeGPT

Welcome to the GitHub repository for **YouTubeGPT**, an AI-powered tool that allows users to interact with YouTube videos through dynamic conversations. By leveraging Long Context Language Models (LCLMs), YouTubeGPT enables users to ask questions and gain structured insights about a video’s content without having to watch the entire thing.

## About

YouTubeGPT extracts and processes key video information—including the title, transcript, and metadata—to provide detailed, context-aware responses to user queries. This allows for a deeper understanding of the sequence of events, main themes, and critical moments within the video.
